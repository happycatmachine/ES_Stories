Hi there, this is the units list, where it all started.

What may not be apparent is that there are more columns to the right, if you press shift and spin your wheel while over the table, they should scroll over. Once again, any edits you make to individual units will be later overwritten (in an update you have to forcefully install lol)

Except this column to the right full_chip-name. These changes will be saved on your device.

There's a a menu 

![[units_base.base]]
