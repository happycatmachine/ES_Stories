There is no usability here, except it is Obsidian.

You can access any of the files in the vault in the hierarchical view to the left of me....erm you.

Where the meat is: [[units]] is kind of cool. Obsidian's ways of making new filters is still a bit arcane but the idea is...


> [!Warning] Don't edit units (or expect them to get overwritten)
> Don't edit individual units, they are constantly under change and get overwritten if you download a new patch file. Tables relying on changing field names need revising when such a change occurs, but that is something I can handle if it breaks (or you can try to fix it yourself :)






Full of don'ts, what to do?

Oh check the units link I sent you earlier. On the far right you see a chip name column. That is a single file that refers to both sides of the chip.

Stay with me here.

When you use both side of a chip you get to flip it (a very cool tactile experience)

It's also that a narrat... you got it. So that thing you click, some have them already (2 or 3 already created by AI to envision a potential)
