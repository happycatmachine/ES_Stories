There is no usability here, except it is Obsidian.

You can access any of the files in the vault in the hierarchical view on the left.

Where the meat is: [[units]] is kind of cool. Obsidian's ways of making new filters is still a bit arcane but the idea is...


> [!Warning] Don't edit units (or expect them to get overwritten)
> Don't edit individual units, they are constantly under change and get overwritten if you download a new patch file. Tables relying on changing field names need revising when such a change occurs, but that is something I can handle if it breaks (or you can try to fix it yourself :)



Full of don'ts, what to do?
