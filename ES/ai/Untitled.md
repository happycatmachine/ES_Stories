Let's start with defining characteristics of our parties.

Rosette Blitzkrieg (we'll just call her Blitz) is a High Elf Sorcerer, she/her.

J1 is a Khajiit Burglar, she/her. Likes the 3 Loot Dice (6 sided). 

Artemis is a Redguard Spellsword, he/him

Thornweaver is an Orc Archer, she/her

The scenario arc in terms of combat encounters will be as follows

Meet and greet.

An encounter with bandits who are tormenting a Skeever Pup. The players, after defeating the bandits gain the Skeever Pup as a companion.

Later, after maybe a town visit...

An encounter at night, along the road. 

A group of bandits and marauders are camped alongside the road, the players have a chance to ambush them. It looks like there could be treasure in it. (This interests J1, of course, who is always on the lookout for loot)

The players have an ambush ability (this is not detailed in the board game but I'm introducing the mechanic. I won't explain the details right now as they are not of interest to the narrative)

They will be able to enter the map unseen

After this conflict, players make their way to somewhere else (perhaps a gambling game)

We could be nearing our game time limit at this point. If we have to progress to another fight, like an end boss then we could potentially do that. I could set it up and then let them decide.
