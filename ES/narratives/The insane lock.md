# The insane lock
The locks complexity reveals to you that it will take you two turns to conquer it. You aren't even sure what you need to do yet. You can choose to commit to this as an action during any of your turns.
## 1st lock
Roll 1 die three times. Each roll must be less than the previous roll. You can change the die faces at a cost of 1 light fatigue for each + or - 1.

Four times may be better, the math is easier and the tradeoffs easy to understand, but too much fatigue?
