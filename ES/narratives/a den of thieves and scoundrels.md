Option: Ambush - You have initiative, one adventurer can ambush, all of your damage being true damage.

4. [[Redguard Bandit]]1
5. [[Orc Bandit]]1


## Battle map

Pile of health chips, pc + 1 in centre of map
Other units surround the fire with health chips obscuring their identities.
Players have initiative, and can start from any hex.

Players can interact with the fire, they don't quite realise how though, perhaps if they got a bit closer...

Players can interact with the fire in the following way:
- When adjacent to the fire, the player can kick it in a conical direction opposite their position.
- 2 adjacent units take 1 true damage.

Map transitions

if players choose to ambush then have them roll a die. On 5 or 6, unit 3 rises and takes a step south to look into the woods.
