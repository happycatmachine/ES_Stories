## Mission text
As you walk along the trail in darkness, you hear the sounds of laughing and loud voices up ahead.

Surrounding a burning fire are a rough looking collection of bandits and scoundrels. That might be a Marauder in back there.

Option: Walk away, caution is best 1xp

Option: Ambush

You have initiative, one adventurer can ambush, all of your damage being true damage.

## Battle map

Pile of health chips, pc + 1 in centre of map
Other units surround the fire with health chips obscuring their identities.
Players have initiative, and can start from any hex.

Players can interact with the fire, they don't quite realise how though, perhaps if they got a bit closer...

Players can interact with the fire in the following way:
- When adjacent to the fire, the player can kick it in a conical direction opposite their position.
- 2 adjacent units take 1 true damage.
