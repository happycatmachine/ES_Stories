# Rule changes

## native

**Native** skill is a Vine Snare (range 2) that they try to grab targeted unit with, 2 light fatigue to avoid else daze.

## chips and handling

ALL unit chips (including allies) are not to be turned over unless explicitly instructed to do so. There are exceptions, the [[Clannfear]]

Dead units will be removed from the board by the host when the need arises. Dead units on the board are not obstacles to movement.

## overland map

Are we doing the map, the day thing, the meters changing?

## initiative

Initiative, comes at some cost? Fatigue? Has a random element. 

Per player initiative, driven by narrative.
