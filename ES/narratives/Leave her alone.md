# Leave her ALONE


## narrative

The sound of a pained, high-pitched squeal cuts through the humidity. 

A [[Skeever Pup]] is being surrounded by four brigands [[Orc Bandit]], [[Khajit Bandit]], [[Argonian Marauder]], [[Breton Bandit]]. You see no net. Clearly they are seeking this poor creature's pelt.


When [[Jaelle toon]] gets to X she rolls a die, and spots something in the underbrush. She sees the "Tormentor" laughing as he prods a [[Skeever Pup]]’s flank with the spear-tip

## The Battle Mat: The Mud-Slick Clearing

This isn't a permanent camp; it's just a spot where five bandits have pulled off the trail to amuse themselves.

- **The Center:** A shallow, muddy pit. The **Skeever Pup** is trapped here, frantically trying to climb the slippery sides while a bandit pokes at it with a blunt spear.
- **The Terrain:** Dense **Fern Thickets** (Obscuring Terrain) surround the clearing, perfect for the party to emerge from.
- **The Enemies:** * **The Tormentor:** A bandit holding a spear, focused on the pit.
    - **Two Sentries:** Lounging against a fallen log, sharing a flask of cheap mead.
- **The "J1 Choice":** treasure spawn on die roll 2+ success. Place this die in your cooldown.

### The Transition to Combat

The sound of a pained, high-pitched squeal cuts through the humidity. [[Jaelle toon]] is the first to reach the edge of the brush. She sees the "Tormentor" laughing as he prods the pup’s flank with the spear-tip.

"Look at it squirm," the bandit jeers. "Filthy thing’s got spirit, I’ll give it that."

Behind [[Jaelle toon]], **Thornweaver** narrows her eyes, her hand tightening on her bow. To an Orc who respects the raw strength of the wild, this isn't just cruelty—it’s a waste of a hunter's spirit. **Artemis** shifts his weight, his blade clearing its scabbard with a faint _hiss_, while **Blitz** begins to gather the static of the forest air between her palms.

[[Jaelle toon]] feels that familiar itch in her palms—the 3 Loot Dice are calling to her from that satchel on the log. But then the pup let out another yelp, and her focus snaps back to the spear-tip.

**The Moment of Initiation:** The bandits are completely unaware. They think they are the apex predators of this little patch of Valenwood.
