# Tavern meet

### The Setting: The Amber-Glow Taphouse

The tavern is built into the hollow of a massive Graht-oak. The walls are polished wood, and the "wares" (the chips) are stacks of rare Valenwood vintage, imported dried meats, and precious resins.

### The Battle Mat: The Taproom Scuffle

- **The North Wall (The Wares):** A long row of **6-8 stacks of chips**. These are the objectives.
- **The Hazard: Collateral Damage.** If an enemy is defeated in a hex adjacent to one or more wares stacks, the "death throes" (a falling body, a stray blade, a magical burst) 
	- remove 2 chips from adjacent wares stacks.
- **The Timer:** A **3-Round Track**. At the end of Round 3, the guards arrive. Success is measured by how many stacks remain.
- **The Enemies:** A rowdy group of **Graht-Hopper Drunks** and **Brutish Mercenaries** who have started a brawl that is quickly turning into a riot.


The atmosphere in the _Amber-Glow_ was supposed to be a reprieve. **Blitz** was likely eyeing the top-shelf magicka-infused wines, while **Artemis** leaned his two-handed blade against the bar, finally catching his breath. **Thornweaver** stood back, always wary of enclosed spaces, and **J1**... well, J1 was likely calculating the coin-value of every patron in the room.

The peace shatters when a massive Nord mercenary slams a tankard into a Bosmer’s face. "The Pact is for cowards!" he roars. "I’ll eat what I want and break what I want!"

He lunges toward the display wall, reaching for a stack of rare resins.

**Artemis** and **Blitz** both react instantly. Their hands reach for the same weave of Destruction magic. The air hums with a dual-frequency—Blitz’s raw, soaring arcane power clashing with the more rhythmic, martial channeling of Artemis.

"Watch your aim, Spellsword," **Blitz** warns, her eyes glowing with violet light. "If you blast them too close to the shelves, we’re losing the bonus."

**Thornweaver** has already notched a blunt-tip arrow, aiming to trip a drunkard before he can stumble into the wine. **J1** is already moving—not toward the exit, but toward the space _between_ the rioters and the loot. For her, those chips aren't just tavern wares; they're the party's ticket to better gear.

1 xp per surviving stack, 4 if all three full
