Some [[Skeever Pup]] just tried to steal my lunch.

Over  the next two battles the [[Skeever Pup]] evolves into a [[Skeever]].

"Friend of the Skeevers" title. Random shop item for free. No action needed. Once per landmark.

At the end of battle, if [[Skeever Pup]] has taken at least 1 wound, [[Skeever Pup]] regains 2 HP and can be bonus, when @7 HP chips, evolves to Skeever, keeping the HP gain, but losing the add 2 HP effect.
