  - The heavy-armored Imperial Enforcer realizes his shield is fracturing. He shouts a command and drops into a defensive crouch, creating a sudden line of sight. From the shadows directly behind him, the Wood Elf Deadeye looses a shaft of arrows, the "Vinesnare" ability pinning you in place before you can pursue the retreating soldier.
