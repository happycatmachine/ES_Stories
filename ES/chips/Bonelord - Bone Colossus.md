  - The Bonelord keeps its distance (Range 6), its spectral form protected by a shimmering barrier as it casts "Decay" to whittle down your stamina. Realising its physical form is "Weak" against your advancing strikes, it initiates a desperate "Necromancy" ritual—but not to summon minions. It raises its staff, and the scattered bones of the crypt fly toward the caster. With a sickening crunch, the Bonelord is pulled into the centre of a swirling vortex of skeletal remains. The bones fuse together, snapping into place to build a massive, extra-skeletal cage around the summoner. The entity expands, rising to a "Colossal" height that scrapes the ceiling. The staff is gone, replaced by a massive, bony fist; the caster is now a Bone Colossus, shifting its behaviour to purely "Aggressive" as it swings a heavy limb to crush you.
