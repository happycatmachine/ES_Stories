# Untraining
- Health, Stamina, and Combat cannot be untrained entirely, however one can untrain the square tokens (or combat dice) in those lines.
- Magicka can be untrained. It can be retrained at a trainer just like other skills
- You can untrain a single (or multiple) dice in a skill line. When you do so you can move the dice to fill the gap.
