This is my first git-thingy so apologies for the mess...then I've never seen a git page that has appealed to me.

Anyway, this is a Vault. It's intent is to provide a framework for creating Elder Scrolls (BOTSE) narratives (stories, adventures, and so on) Right now it's more a storage structure for such narratives, the UI and the friendliness (of where there is none) is reliant on what Obsidian provides.

It works with Obsidian. No addons needed but do have a play with the appearance settings to your taste.

I don't expect any of it will make any immediate sense (or need to) but if you want to Q&D 3 minute explanation: I'm available, a lot, at my Zoom room and can walk individuals or groups through it (from installation to use)

It's an ongoing project that has finally got some teeth and I hope I can make it worth your attention, some time.
