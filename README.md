Is thi..

THis is my first git-thingy so apologies for the mess...then I've never seen a git page that has appealed to me.

Anyway, this is a Vault

It works with Obsidian. No addons needed but do have a play with the appearance settings to your taste.

That I have to give you this with instructions is a failing on my part. 

It's an ongoing project that has finally got some teeth and I hope I can make it worth your attention some time.

I'm available, a lot, at my Zoom room and can walk individuals or groups through what exactly this is in about 3 minutes.
