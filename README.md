Is thi..

THis is my first git-thingy so apologies for the mess...then I've never seen a git page that has appealed to me.

Anyway, this is a Vault

It works with Obsidian. No addons needed but do have a play with the appearance settings to your taste.

I don't expect any of it will make any immediate sense (or need to) but if you want to Q&D 3 minute explanation: I'm available, a lot, at my Zoom room and can walk individuals or groups through it (from installation to use)

It's an ongoing project that has finally got some teeth and I hope I can make it worth your attention, some time.
